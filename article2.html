                  A year ago, I was packing up my things in France, 
                  saying goodbye to my students and returning to 
                  London after seven months of assisting in English 
                  language teaching. Today, I am working from home 
                  and learning to code in my spare time. Although 
                  the view from my window doesn’t match the greenery 
                  of Burgundy forests, I'm just as challenged in my 
                  life as I was then. I swapped French grammar that was 
                  full of exceptions to many, many rules for languages 
                  that strictly follow the rules they’re built on.
                </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Like most millennials, I’ve grown up with technology and, 
                  like most young teens, I was the designated tech-related 
                  problem solver in my family. This and the fact that when 
                  I was 10, I used my mum’s card to buy credit on an online 
                  game called Stardoll. My mum has never been able to fully 
                  comprehend how her adolescent child could make a payment 
                  online while she had trouble navigating the menu on the 
                  cash machine. Although my passion for technology is quite 
                  recent, I’ve always been interested to know where things 
                  come from and how they are made – I’m (only now) not ashamed 
                  to admit that I have lost hours watching How It’s Made on 
                  YouTube. My inquisitive nature is what led me move to France 
                  without knowing any French and it’s what motivates me to learn 
                  how to code without so much as a smidgen of experience in STEM.

                <p>
                    At school there wasn't much of an emphasis on technology, 
                    so I focused on the humanities subjects I enjoyed and ultimately 
                    graduated with a degree in English literature. My more active 
                    interest in technology began in 2019 when I enrolled to study 
                    a master’s in Digital Asset and Media Management at King's College
                     - a course on digital media studies and research methods. In a 
                     module called Web Technologies, I wrote my first line of code and 
                     it felt good to see 'bananas' printed on the plain web page in Times 
                     New Roman. Once I realised that all my involvement in group projects were 
                     tech related, I made the decision to withdraw from the course 
                     and pursue coding independently. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I didn’t know where to start but I knew that technology was pioneering 
                    a change in gender diversity and I was interested to find out more. I 
                    first heard about CodeFirst:Girls while I was serving jury duty. 
                    I was speaking about my newfound interest in technology and a fellow 
                    juror spoke to me about their daughter being involved in an organisation 
                    that teaches women how to code. The rest is history! Well, not quite. I 
                    applied to the free community courses organised by Cf:G and partner 
                    organisations. I got rejected twice before I successfully enrolled to 
                    learn to code Python - the Level 2 course recommended to be taken after the 
                    Level 1 Introduction to Front-end Development. So, my start to 
                    programming was, in a way, backwards.  
                </p>
                                <p>
                    I enjoyed the learning environment very much - it was a supportive 
                    and encouraging place. It felt good to meet many different women 
                    with various educational and work backgrounds knowing that my English 
                    literature degree was just as relevant as a computer science one. 
                    However, as I was one of the only two people to skip the recommended 
                    prerequisite course, learning Python was not as easy as typing 
                    /h1/bananas /h1/ in Brackets editor. But I sat next to an intelligent 
                    woman who supported me a lot and calmly managed my incessant whispered 
                    Q&As. She also told me that learning to code is learning to think differently 
                    about information. Coming from a creative background, I was used to
                     interpreting meaning as opposed to taking information at face-value. 
                     Eventually, it became obvious that a computer is, indeed, just a 
                     machine that wants to be told what to do.
